# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 1 - JSX Elements

**Thoughts:** I'm starting this challenge with learning React. My goal is to become a Front-End Developer, and to do so I need to pick up some JS Libraries like React and Node. I am going to be using Codecademy, which has been the most effective method of learning code for me.

### Day 2: April 19, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 2 - Advanced JSX

**Thoughts:** There was a lot more information thrown at me, but I know that I'm not expected to remember it all at once. Even so, I'll recap so that I can look back and say, 'yeah, I remember that!'

**Lesson Recap:** 
- Use className instead of class for HTML elements. 
- Close img and br tags />. 
- Use curlys {} when injecting regular JS. 
- You can call variables with injected JS. 
- Write event listeners in camelCase. 
- Use if statements outside of JSX. 
- Remember x ? y : z (if x is true, execute y, else z). 
- Use .map() to make a list of JSX elements. 
- Use keys to order a list (key=" "). 
- You can write in React without JSX with React.createElement();.

### Day 3: April 20, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 3 - React Components

**Thoughts:** I decided to challenge myself this time by trying to remember code from the previous two days. I can say I'm quite proud of myself. I can now make a component without having to look at the example code. Though I do have to admit it took me some time to create a conditional statement without using if/else. It wasn't required, but I wanted to try anyway.

### Day 4: April 22, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 4 - This.props & Event Handlers

**Thoughts:** I struggled for a while as I tried to understand what the Codecademy lesson was trying to tell me to do. I finally gave up and let it give me the answer, and I facepalmed. It's always that one small thing that messes you up...

### Day 5: April 24, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 5 - This.state, Constructors and super(props)

**Thoughts:** Loved how there is no explanation as to why super(props) is needed in order to pass this to a state inside a constructor. Oh well, just another mystery to add next to how people still believe the world is flat.
