# 100 Days Of Code - Log

### Day 1: April 18, 2018

**Today's Progress**: Learning React.JS Part 1 - JSX Elements

**Thoughts:** I'm starting this challenge with learning React. My goal is to become a Front-End Developer, and to do so I need to pick up some JS Libraries like React and Node. I am going to be using Codecademy, which has been the most effective method of learning code for me.
